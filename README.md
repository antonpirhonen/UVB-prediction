<h1>UVB prediction from air temperature with polynomial regression</h1>

In this project I use Python Library *Sci-kit learn* to predict the intensity of UVB radiation from air temperature using polynomial regression. This project was conducted for the course CS-C3240 Machine learning of Aalto University.
